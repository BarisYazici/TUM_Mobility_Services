# Summary
The Car as a Service market undergoes a progressive trend in growth due to innovative tech-
nologies and higher interconnectivity in the automotive industry. By 2018, all new vehicles in
Europe are obligated to be equipped with a SIM-card in order to adapt to the eCall functionality
for sending emergency signals. Also, the European legislation set up a roadmap for providing
the necessary infrastructure in the following years. This trend of high interconnectivity is al-
ready visible in the fleet management market.
Based on the latter, our team – Be Most Wanted – came up with an idea of making use of new
services in the latter discussed telematics market. Providing fleet managers with the highest
information depth while at the same time emphasizing major problems within the fleet lead to
an overall simplified fleet management. Moreover, costs regarding maintenance of vehicles,
fuels costs and others can be saved. The result of the project is a web platform built for fleet
managers to oversee the status of the vehicles, the driving behaviour of employees and the costs
of fuel amongst others. All of those features are included in a notification centre where prob-
lems based on a pre-set threshold are shown to the fleet manager. By using the BMW CarData
platform, vehicles can easily be registered in the FleetMe system without the need of installing
any hardware components. Following the design thinking approach, the idea of the fleet man-
agement software was iteratively adapted and renewed. In this report all steps from the ideation
to the implementation of the prototype as well as the calculation of a financial business case are
detailed. Thereby, the project was part of the Advanced Practical Course Automotive/Mobility
Services in the winter term of 2017/2018.
